# midnight-coffee-break
## [Prompt]

Cozy coffee brewing during a warm summer night in a rural setting. 

## [Future features]

I'm planning to add ghosts as NPC's. The overall gameplay is going to be visual novel-esque. NPC's come and go, tell the you about their day while you are making them coffee. ​

## [Controls]​

- "WASD" + Mouse for moving around
- "E" (Use) to open doors, activate machines, take items. If the item is interactable, the crosshair changes to a hand when looking directly at an item.
- "F" to drop items
- "Left Shift" to sprint
